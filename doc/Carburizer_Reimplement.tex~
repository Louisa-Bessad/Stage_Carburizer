\section{Abstract}
Carburizer was created to insure; input checking from the driver, a failure detection before corruption appears and a fix of device failures. In this way the reliability of systems can be improved. But it does not handle all issues and few platforms or drivers had been tested. The goal of this document is to reimplement some funtions of Carburizer. In this way; we have to loof for different types of code.
